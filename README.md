Projects

1. Linear Regression – Predicting Insurance Premiums

Objective: Develop a regression model to forecast insurance charges based on factors like age, BMI, and type of disease. The project identifies critical features influencing premium costs.
Problem Statement: Insurance premiums are continuous variables dependent on multiple features. Using regression techniques, we aim to make accurate predictions and uncover key influencing factors.

2. Binary Classification – Customer Churn Prediction

Objective: Create a model to predict customer churn for service companies, helping businesses identify customers at risk of leaving.
Problem Statement: Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on identifying customers likely to churn using machine learning classification techniques.

3. Time Series Forecasting – Furniture Sales Prediction

Objective: Build a forecasting model to predict future furniture sales based on historical data, helping business owners estimate trends and plan effectively.
Problem Statement: Understanding product popularity and its impact on business is critical. This time series model predicts sales trends, aiding decision-making.

4. Clustering – Customer Segmentation

Objective: Segment mall customers into clusters based on shopping patterns, spending behavior, and other factors. These clusters help tailor marketing strategies and offers to different customer groups.
Problem Statement: Use clustering techniques to create actionable customer profiles that improve engagement and satisfaction.

Games
