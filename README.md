i have worked on 4 different datasets and used diffrent machine learning algorithms 

Project 1. Linear Regression 
Insurance premium is an amount of money a person  or business pays for an insurance policy that covers health, vehicle, home, life insurances etc. The insurer provides coverage for claims made against the policy.  Premiums are paid either quarterly, half-yearly or yearly depending upon the terms and conditions. 
If we talk about health insurance, there are various factors on which the premium amount is dependent on. The premium amount might depending upon these factors like age ,type of disease ,Body Mass Index etc

Problem statement
our goal is to forecast  insurance  charges . insurance Premium is  based  on different  variables.  as a  result, insurance fees are continuous values. the regression is the best choice available to  fulfill our needs.
Also to identify features are important while doing the predictions 



Project 2 Binary Classification
One of the greatest challenges faced by service companies is to retain its customers. The cost involved in targeting new customers is a lot more than the effort to retain the existing ones. One of the greatest challenges faced by service companies is to retain its customers. Keeping this in mind, companies (that also includes banks) try to get some insights into the customer data

Problem statement
Our goal is to identify those customers who are likely to leave (churn). 





Project 3 Time Series

Every business owner’s objective is to estimate the future trends – in terms of sales, profits, gains etc. To do this analysis, the owner first has to segregate the data by category and analyze each entity separately. For each entity, a forecast can be estimated based on the past sales of that entity. The idea behind this is to find out the popularity of a certain product and how its sales can impact the business

Problem statement
Build a forecast model to predict the Furniture sales of a certain store



Project 4 Clustering

Customers who come for shopping in a mall can be grouped in a number of ways. Shopping pattern, spending pattern, shopping score, salary etc are some of the factors that can be used to divide the customers into different categories.
The reason for these clusters is to help identify those customers who would be interested in certain products, offers and services.

Problem statement
To create Customer cluster to identify the different types of customers
